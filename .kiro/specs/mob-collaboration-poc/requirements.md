# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI-SLDC Mob Collaboration System POC aims to create a unified context layer that enables seamless collaboration across all roles in a software development team through Model Context Protocol (MCP). This system extends mob programming concepts to the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) by providing a Central Context Engine (CCE) that aggregates information from various tools (GitHub, Jira, CI/CD, monitoring, etc.) and makes it available to any AI tool or team member through standardized MCP interfaces.

The POC will demonstrate core functionality with a minimal viable implementation focusing on GitHub integration, basic task management, and MCP server capabilities that can serve context to AI tools.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to connect my AI coding assistant to the MCP server so that it can access current project context including recent commits, open issues, and test results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer configures their AI tool with the MCP server endpoint THEN the system SHALL authenticate the connection and provide available context tools
2. WHEN the AI tool requests project context THEN the system SHALL return structured data including recent commits, open issues, and build status within 2 seconds
3. WHEN the developer asks their AI assistant about project status THEN the assistant SHALL receive relevant context and provide accurate information with source citations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to query the system about project progress so that I can understand current status, blockers, and upcoming deliverables without manually checking multiple tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a product manager queries project status through an AI tool THEN the system SHALL provide a role-specific view including milestone progress, open issues by priority, and recent deployments
2. WHEN asking about blockers THEN the system SHALL identify and return issues marked as blockers with their dependencies and assignees
3. WHEN requesting timeline information THEN the system SHALL provide estimated completion dates based on current velocity and remaining work

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to access deployment and infrastructure context so that I can quickly understand system health, recent changes, and potential issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a DevOps engineer queries system status THEN the system SHALL provide deployment history, build status, and any failed tests or deployments
2. WHEN investigating incidents THEN the system SHALL correlate recent commits, deployments, and test failures to help identify root causes
3. WHEN planning deployments THEN the system SHALL provide information about pending changes, test coverage, and deployment readiness

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want to access test results and quality metrics so that I can understand test coverage, flaky tests, and areas needing attention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a QA engineer requests test status THEN the system SHALL provide recent test runs, pass/fail rates, and flaky test identification
2. WHEN analyzing test coverage THEN the system SHALL show coverage metrics per component and highlight areas with low coverage
3. WHEN investigating test failures THEN the system SHALL provide failure history, related commits, and potential causes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to get comprehensive project insights so that I can make informed decisions about resource allocation, priorities, and risk management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a team lead requests project overview THEN the system SHALL provide team velocity, burndown charts, and risk indicators
2. WHEN analyzing team performance THEN the system SHALL show metrics like PR review times, deployment frequency, and incident resolution times
3. WHEN planning sprints THEN the system SHALL provide capacity analysis and suggest optimal task distribution

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure and manage the MCP server so that it can securely connect to various development tools and serve context to authorized AI tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring tool integrations THEN the system SHALL support OAuth/API key authentication for GitHub, Jira, and CI/CD systems
2. WHEN managing access control THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based permissions and audit all context requests
3. WHEN monitoring system health THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on data freshness, API response times, and error rates

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As any team member, I want the system to automatically update context in real-time so that I always have access to current information without manual refresh.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN changes occur in connected systems THEN the system SHALL receive webhook notifications and update context within 30 seconds
2. WHEN context is updated THEN the system SHALL notify subscribed AI tools through WebSocket connections
3. WHEN webhook delivery fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff and dead letter queuing
